# Item-Catalog
In this project, I will be developing a web application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories and integrate third party user registration and authentication. Authenticated users should have the ability to post, edit, and delete their own items.

Udacity Nanodegree: Full Stack Web Developer.

Purpose of the code:
- the HTML (structure of the pages)
- the CSS (the style of the pages)
- the Flask Application (to put it online)
- it must include authentication/authorization to allow users to login before making changes
- the database (to store and organize the information)

How to run the application:

In order to run the application we need to have Python 2.7 installed on our computer.

1) Open the directory by command line where the files are located: project.py, database_setup.py

2) Run the file database_setup.py through the pyhton command to create a structure Data Base.

Example for windows operating system: C:\example_dir\python database_setup.py

3) Run the file project.py through the python command.

Example for windows operating system: C:\example_dir\python project.py

4) Access via browser to the address http://localhost:5000
